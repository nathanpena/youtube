# YouTube Automation and Data Analysis Project

This project demonstrates my ability to develop and integrate software that automates interactions with YouTube, collects data, and presents it in a structured way for analysis. The project leverages JavaScript for front-end functionality and interaction, and materializes UI components to create a responsive and interactive interface.

## Overview

The project involves the creation of an automated tool that interacts with YouTube, allowing the user to manage playlists and analyze content. Through the combination of web technologies, this project highlights my expertise in software engineering, automation, and data analysis.

### Skills Demonstrated:

- **Web Automation**: By automating YouTube interactions using JavaScript and integrating API calls, I can manage and manipulate YouTube content, a task often required in data engineering for automating data collection and transformation.
- **Data Analysis**: The project includes mechanisms to gather information from YouTube playlists, which can be analyzed to generate insights on user behavior, video popularity, or content trends.
- **Software Engineering**: The structured JavaScript code ensures efficient and modular design, making the project scalable and maintainable. This reflects key principles of software engineering, such as modularity, code reuse, and clean architecture.

## Features

- **YouTube Interaction**: Automated interaction with YouTube playlists through JavaScript.
- **Data Collection**: Collects and presents data for analysis, allowing insights into YouTube content and user behavior.
- **UI with Materialize**: Uses the Materialize framework to build a clean and responsive interface for easier navigation and user interaction.

## How This Applies to Data Engineering & Data Analysis

- **Automation**: This project showcases my ability to automate data collection tasks, which is key in building data pipelines and ETL processes in data engineering.
- **Data Handling**: By collecting data from YouTube playlists, this project demonstrates my ability to gather, manipulate, and prepare data for analysis, which is essential in data analysis roles.
- **Software Development**: The combination of front-end web development and automated data collection highlights my full-stack capabilities, making me proficient in creating end-to-end data solutions, from gathering to analysis.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3. The project will load and you can interact with the YouTube features from there.
